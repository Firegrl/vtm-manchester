# Camarilla

## The Prince of Manchester

Ventrue Prince of Manchester. Although very young for a local leader, she was officially given the title by the higher eschelons of the Camarilla due to her foresight and strategy in dismantling a kindred-hunting organisation similar to Operation Antigen from gaining a foothold in the Northern City. 

Many of the Camarilla were content for unruly, rebellious and Anarch-ruled Manchester to fall to the forces of modern mortal military might, as once did London, but the Prince-to-be managed to broker a treaty between all of the creatures that lurk in shadow. 

What training she has been given is not known. Whispers suggest that she was allowed to ritually diablerise a failed former Prince of a once important British holding as both a reward and a chain to bind her close to the Ivory Tower

This appointment annoyed many of the old lords and barons who occupy Manchester and it's surrounding environs. Many of the old families, who contributed little to keeping the mortal menace at bay (they believed they were powerful enough financially and politically to consider the true threat) hold a grudge or feel that they would be better suited to be Prince.

Her collaborative leadership style is contraversial even in the Camerilla, but the Prince's true talent seems to lie in negotiation, compromise and collaboration. As long as she gets results, she will not be questioned. She is want to assign fledglings to multidisciplinary inter-clan coteries as her pawns in her grand strategy. Oftentimes, this leads to successful results from varied teams, but it also leads to friction and bad blood between creatures of the night with diametrically opposed convictions.
