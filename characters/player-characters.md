### Laura Whitworth / Grace du Nuit - Clan Toreador - 13th Generation

Laura was a dedicated police woman and former Detective Seargent, who got results and prioritised public safety, however she was frequently passed over for promotion by her Male colleagues.
She began to take out her frustrations through art, specifically painting.
She was invited to a small gallery, under the stage name Grace du Nuit. 
This lead to a powerful Toreador named Christine Van de Meer taking interest in Laura's emotional expression through her art.
Laura made money from the exhibition and decided to leave the police force, and shortly after was sired by Christine.

### Baron Anton Liviu - Clan Ventrue 10th Generation

Baron Anton Liviu is one of the oldest Vampires of the region, and former Lord of the City. He built his estate and his small empire, and when he found out about 'interest rates' he invested his money and entered Torpor, hoping to wake up to even more wealth. However, upon waking he finds his house quite diminished and his investments dried up by a mysterious antagonist, using a string of shell companies to siphon his once vast fortunes and power over time.

He has very.... traditional views.

His main estate is in Altringham, and boasts a garden maze and the North's most complex fountain display crowned by a modest manor with 8 bedrooms, 5 bathrooms, sever access, a secret entrance and a wine cellar dutifully stocked with fine blood. He keeps a small herd of Ghouls as staff. Additionally, he maintains a small but well appointed flat in Elizabeth Tower south of Deansgate.

In these modern nights, he is without much of his former slendour. Even his title of 'Baron' is somewhat superficial, as the Camarilla at large do not recognise his Barony over any area of the City.
