# SO28

United Kingdom Anti-Terrorism Unit Specialist Operations Branch 28 was announced following the Manchester Arena attack to placate the public and, officially, '...detect and prevent Terrorist actions on the people of Manchester'. Their main function, however, was to be a militarized branch of the same organisation that funded Operation Antigen in London, which successfully managed to tip the balance in one of the Camarilla's longest-held strongholds.

Antigen was the test project, but SO28 was meant to refine and perfect the art of subjugating the night. It was to be the spearhead into the North and a base for operations further afield.

Despite billions of pounds spent and experiences manpower almost one thousand strong, they were narrowly prevented from gaining a foothold in Manchester by an alliance between all of the creatures of the night in December of 2022.
