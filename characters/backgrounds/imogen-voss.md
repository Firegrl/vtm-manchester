# Bio

Dr. Imogen Voss is constructed to make the most of the Malkavian curse—an exquisite engine for uncanny insight. Within any coterie, her role is clear: she is the abstract thinker, the nonlinear logician, the one who follows the thread others overlook. She sees what others do not, and attempts what no one else would dare consider. Whether this brilliance comes from her formidable intellect or the whispering architecture of her Madness Network is a matter of interpretation—hers shifts nightly.

Her talents lean heavily on **Auspex**, and her worldview is as fluid, recursive, and strange as the discipline allows. She senses what is unseen, perceives what is about to be, and occasionally catches glimpses of what once was. Past and future are, to Imogen, merely two mislabeled drawers in the same filing cabinet—and she opens the wrong one more often than not.

This confusion is both her weapon and her wound. Those who meet her are never sure whether to treat her pronouncements as grave prophecy or eccentric rambling. Her feeding habits illustrate this beautifully. A strict consensualist, she is unfailingly honest about her nature—but her would-be vessels rarely believe her. Most assume she’s immersed in some elaborate vampire LARP, a misconception she has no intention of correcting. If mortals wish to supply her with vitae while imagining her a particularly earnest performer, so much the better.

Like many of her bloodline, Imogen’s thirst for knowledge is bottomless. She delights in understanding how things function and will happily dismantle gadgets, essential household items, or—when curiosity truly strikes—human bodies, simply to see what makes them tick. This relentless inquiry has honed her skills in science, technology, and medicine, complementing her preternatural insights.

But her life spent in libraries and cloistered halls has left its mark. She lacks the physical prowess and refined social graces of many of her peers. Some find her eccentric charm endearing; others think her as mad as a box of frogs. Her deficiencies extend into the digital age—modern devices frustrate her because she cannot easily pry them open—and she displays anachronistic reactions to garlic, crucifixes, running water, and crossing thresholds uninvited. These should be superstition in the modern nights; in her case, they are inconveniently real.

Still, Imogen brings considerable assets to any coterie. Not least among them is her roster of contacts. Foremost is her long-suffering ghoul and teaching assistant, Edeline “Eddie” Winterborn, who dutifully embarks on whatever fetch-quest her regnant envisions. Another invaluable connection is Selene Crowther, a mortal antiquarian bookseller whose shop has seen more obscure tomes pass through its hands than most university archives. Selene remains unaware of Imogen’s true nature, but has read enough to be entirely unshocked by whatever strange requests the doctor brings to her door. And Voss is far from the only patron with unusual interests.

## Life Before Undeath

Imogen Haworth was born with an appetite for knowledge so fierce it unsettled those around her. Her father, Gideon—a minister of steady principles—encouraged her studies, proud of her sharp mind. Her mother, Prudence, watched her with a more anxious eye. If a girl fills her head too far, she warned once, something inside is bound to crack. She was not entirely wrong.

At the Whitby Ladies’ Academy, Imogen outpaced her peers with effortless precision. She devoured journals and treatises, and on restless nights submitted her own essays under the pseudonym Acton Ellis, careful to cloak her gender in initials and restraint.

When the United Kingdom offered her no path to further education, she accepted a post as a governess—an occupation so stifling she feared her intellect would wither. Then came the letter.
Maryam Voss, a lecturer at the University of Zurich, had uncovered her secret identity and invited her to attend a series of private seminars. Reverend Haworth, seeing both the danger and futility of denying his daughter's hunger, reluctantly agreed to let her travel.

In Zurich, Voss became more than a mentor. She fed Imogen’s passions, gently testing the edges of her curiosity, her resilience, her ambition. Long before Imogen guessed it, Voss was measuring her not as a student— but as a potential childe.


## Modern Nights

TBC

## Appearance 

Imogen Voss dresses like a mid-century academic frozen in time, all sharp lines and studied austerity. It’s a calculated affectation, one of her private jokes—after all, she was born in the 1850s, and the aesthetic of the 1950s is, to her, practically modern.

The pencil skirt, the nylon stockings, the sensible heels: none of it is ideal for stalking prey through alleyways, yet Imogen would sooner meet final death than be mistaken for a disheveled fledgling. Her wardrobe is armor of a different kind. Few mortals question the authenticity of her airy claims about belonging to a “vampire LARPing group,” mostly because she looks entirely unlike the cinematic clichés they expect.

Her hair is always swept into a flawlessly precise bun; her lips wear a shade of red that seems a little too close to fresh vitae; and her horn-rimmed glasses rest on her nose purely for effect—her undead eyes see with perfect clarity.

## Touchstones

## Haven

Imogen’s haven is nestled within the **Museum of Manchester**, a place whose quiet reverence for knowledge suits her perfectly. Most nights she retreats to a private, book-laden library tucked away in one of the museum’s towers—an anachronistic sanctuary of paper, dust, and silence. But on occasion she abandons the tower for one of the museum’s curated displays, choosing a glass case or dimly lit exhibit simply because the view is more appealing.

Her favorite is the installation titled **“The Bureau for the Study of Surrealisms and its Legacies.”** Originally conceived as a commentary on the inherent absurdity of museums and their frozen moments in time, the exhibit has become, to Imogen, an unexpectedly comfortable nook. The clash of eras and aesthetics makes perfect sense to her fractured logic.

When the museum is closed to the public and the halls fall quiet, she can often be found conversing with **Stan**, the twelve-foot-tall T. rex skeleton that dominates the dinosaur gallery. Thus far, Stan has not deigned to respond—but Imogen is patient. Bones remember more than they let on, and she fully expects that one night, he will answer.

# Relationships

Despite spending far less time tutoring than she did in her early nights, Imogen still delights in offering extra instruction to mortals who show a sincere enthusiasm for obscure knowledge. Over the decades this habit has produced a long procession of protégés, assistants, and pupils—many of whom still feel a lingering sense of loyalty to the strange, brilliant woman who reshaped their minds.

## Eddie Winterborn
### Research Assistant

Most have drifted on to lives of their own, but Edeline “Eddie” Winterborn has remained steadfastly by her side. Eddie serves as teaching assistant, errand-runner, and Imogen’s primary tether to the modern world. She is far more devoted than most ghouls—perhaps more than a ghoul should be. Whether her ambition lies in becoming something greater, or simply being seen as more than a servant, is unclear. What is clear is that Imogen remains blissfully oblivious to the depth of Eddie’s loyalty, yearning, or hopes.

## Selene Crowther
### Antique Bookseller

Imogen’s other notable contact is Selene Crowther, an antiquarian bookseller with an uncanny knack for acquiring the sorts of texts and artifacts that should not be so readily available. Selene’s network is deep, her favours innumerable, and her discretion impeccable. Unlike Eddie, Selene has no idea that Imogen is Kindred—at least, not in any official sense. But she has read enough forbidden lore, and seen enough curious things, to suspect that Dr. Voss is not merely an eccentric academic who keeps strange hours.
