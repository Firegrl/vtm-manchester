# Bio

Laura was born at some point in the 80’s in Salford, Manchester. She was inspired to join Greater Manchester Police after the robbery & violent murder of her younger sister in the early 2000’s when both were teenagers. This traumatic event split her family apart and her parents are no longer together, divorcing a few short years later while Laura was attending police training. 

## Career

Starting as a lowly constable, Laura’s eye for detail and (probably) neurodivergent mind allowed her to solve certain high-profile cases with relative ease, including bringing in a serial killer known as the Bloody Finger (due to his habit of cutting a finger off the body of each victim), aka Ulysses Varé. Thanks to Laura’s unorthodox work and meticulously-gathered evidence the police were able to nail the fucker, and he is now serving multiple consecutive life sentences. She received little to no real credit for this dangerous work and her journey up the ranks was continually stymied by her male colleagues. Despite this she remained in the police for around 15 years and eventually rose to the rank of Detective Sergeant. 

In addition, there was one particularly bloody case Laura & her colleagues were never able to solve.  A young woman, Karen Genovese, returning from a night out, was found dead with her throat more or less completely torn away. The coroners report indicated the wound appeared to have been made by a set of teeth, rather than a weapon. After a short and unsuccessful investigation, the word came down from on high to drop the case, and shortly afterwards the case files and paperwork were collected one night by a man claiming to be a government agent. This case always nagged at Laura and in her darker moments she regarded it as one of her many failures.

Shortly after finishing her training, she met and fell in love with a man (ew) whom she eventually married. Stephen. He was loving and supportive, but only as far as it suited him to do so. The relationship lasted over a decade, but when Laura got her final promotion to DS Stephen felt threatened by her skill and earning power, and became more markedly abusive, including physically. Laura’s attempts to discuss this with colleagues led to scorn & derision and advice to “toughen up, little girl”. 

After a particularly violent episode, Laura fought back and ended up putting Stephen in the hospital. GMP repeatedly took Stephen’s side, dismissing Laura’s obvious signs of physical abuse and evident trauma. Laura was suspended from the GMP pending a full investigation. Laura, seeing the writing on the wall, jumped before she was pushed and resigned from the police. While Stephen was in hospital, Laura filed her divorce paperwork, packed her things and left the house they shared together, moving into a surprisingly spacious one-bedroom loft apartment by herself. She admits it doesn’t quite suit her needs but she would spend hours staring out of the large windows, looking over the city. She makes a living for herself as a PI & security consultant in the private sector.

## Artistic Side

For many years, Laura has painted with oils, and by now is very skilful with them. Previously these were often bright, warm and colourful pieces. Mostly land or scenescapes of rolling hills and pleasant city spaces, with the occasional portrait upon request. Her work at this time caught some, but not a great deal of attention. Many labelled it as derivative, dull and “the sort of work you see hung up in hotel rooms”. She kept her work and personal lives strictly separated, to the extent that none of her police colleagues even knew she was an artist, even going so far as to exhibit her work under the name Grace de Nuit, referencing her many night shifts in the GMP. She howled with laughter at the Ron Swanson/Duke Silver storyline in Parks & Rec as she found it very relatable.

However, since her escape from Stephen’s clutches her work has become notably darker in tone. Ruined buildings, screaming faces, contorted bodies, twisted landscapes and far darker colours than before. One painting in particular showed a tortured, bruised sky rolling over a blasted, broken landscape but at the very centre of the painting, growing through the wrecked world, a single, lushly-rendered red rose. At a small exhibition of this new work in the Northern Quarter, Laura crossed paths with an older, stylishly attired patron of the arts, who introduced herself as Christine. This is the Toreador Primogen, who would eventually sire her. Laura found herself enraptured by Christine, and frequently found reasons to spend time with her or contact her. 

## Embrace

Christine had of course intended for this all along, and the nominally hetero Laura found herself drawn to Christine in ways she had not experienced before. Christine, for her part, was happy to seduce and eventually sire Laura into the Toreador clan. Christine seized her moment some months ago, after inviting Laura to her apartment (an invitation which Laura enthusiastically accepted). After talking about art and beauty for many hours, Christine gave Laura the Embrace.

Upon awakening many hours later, Laura found herself sick, pained and averse to sunlight. Christine had seemingly remained with her, and explained the nature of Laura’s new existence to her. After some disbelief, Laura began to accept her reality after an attempt to go outside in the dwindling daylight and finding her skin now burns in the sun. Laura bitterly joked to Christine that she won’t be able to wear summery dresses any more. Christine laughed, and stroked Laura’s head affectionately. In that moment, the full truth of her situation washed over her, and her enraged howl of despair shattered every car window for 3 streets. 

Laura is now a vampire of the Toreador clan, and has had to block the windows of her home to prevent sunlight from entering. She misses her view. She has found the change from human to vampire quite difficult, but equally she is fascinated and not a little excited by her suddenly now-different future. At one point Christine and other Toreador clan members had to physically restrain her from finding and killing Stephen. Christine used this as a good opportunity to explain The Masquerade to Laura, and the consequences of breaking it. The Toreadors universally refer to her by her artist name, Grace.

# Touchstones

## Mr & Ms. Whitworth
### Laura's parents

Though separated, both still live in South Manchester, Laura’s parents are becoming increasingly concerned for her welfare and have recently spoken to each other for the first time in years as a result. Neither wants to lose their remaining daughter.

## Sophie, Abigail & Kate
### Laura’s “girl gang”
The four have been friends for many years, with Sophie and Kate having been in the police themselves before leaving for a less shit working environment. They, too, haven’t heard from her in months and have worried about her. They know about Grace du Nuit and have been to a number of her exhibitions to support their friend.

# Relationships

## Christine van der Meer
### Toreador Primogen, Art Collector and Mentor

Christine van der Meer was born in Amsterdam in 1605, into a family made wealthy by Dutch colonialism. She was Embraced into the Toreador clan at age 42 and thus has an eternally middle-aged appearance. Growing up, she spent time with Rembrandt and many other artists, and over the last 400 years has known and worked with many, many of the great European artists, including Monet, Matisse, van Gogh, Dali and scores of others. Sometimes when a promising young artist disappeared from the world, they had in fact been Embraced into the clan. Christine finds beauty in many forms. In battlefield screams, in blood in the moonlight, in the scant remains of fallen civilisations (particularly Sumer), and in the mind of an artistic former detective…

## Stephen
### Former Husband

Stephen Hughes is an arrogant, swaggering techbro who works at MediaCity. He was mentally and physically abusive towards Laura, with his actions escalating over the course of many years. The phrase “he’s not the man I married” is a cliché, but this accurately reflects Laura’s feelings about the relationship. Over the years, Stephen seemed to become envious of Laura’s relative success and ignored the struggles she endured to attain it and despite him earning far more than Laura. He became insistent that she give up her job and become a baby factory. On their final night together, his abuse became sexual when he drunkenly assaulted Laura upon her return from work and tried to rape her. This led to her throwing him off her and, at long last, fighting back. The ensuing fracas ended with Stephen tumbling down the stairs. Laura called an ambulance but did not accompany him to the hospital, telling the medics she would follow in her car. As the ambulance drove away, Laura packed her bag and called an old friend, asking to stay with them for a few nights. Stephen & Laura have not spoken to each other since that night. The divorce papers Laura filed were accepted and signed by Stephen without quibble. He is now officially her ex-husband. Stephen also declined to press charges, aware that his own misdeeds would surely come to light during any investigation, or even a cursory glance at Laura’s many injuries. 

## DCI Raymond Holt
### Retired Detecive and Former Mentor

Very keen on facts and logic, not very keen on emotions. One of only 2 or 3 decent people at GMP, was always relatively supportive and helpful to her in the early years in the job. He retired a few years ago and now spends his time at home with his academic husband and does a lot of gardening. Until a few months ago, Laura would visit them regularly, abiding by the pairs’ “No shop talk” rule and instead discussing music, art, flowers and food. After his retirement, Laura revealed her artistic side to Raymond, and he agreed to keep her secret.

## DI Diana Christiansen
### Professional Rival
Tory Angela, but worse. The two always disliked each other. If Laura found herself forced to feed on Diana, she wouldn’t lose any sleep over it.

## Unknown Serial Killer
### Murderer of Karen Genovese
Now that she knows that Vampires exist, the murder weapon and motive in the Genovese case seems obvious to Laura. While in many ways she has left her police life behind, this case still lives in her mind rent-free and she would be very interested to find and speak to the responsible Kindred. This could be seen as an overarching goal for her.
